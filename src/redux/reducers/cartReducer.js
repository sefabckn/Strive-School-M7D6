// splitting the reducer into multiple ones is a common practise!
// in the first place, it helps us finding the cases into potentially a very long file
// e.g. because for the user's cases we'll have a separate file,
// moreover, it will also simplify the reducers' logic
// because now every reducer will be ASSIGNED to just a slice of the state
// and it will have to mantain and return just its assigned portion :)

// the reducer is a pure function, no side-effects and with the same input
// will always produce the same output and YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MANIPULATE YOUR ARGUMENTS
